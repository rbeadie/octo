        <p class="octo-msg">This simple web app is meant to show how easy it is to install MyBoard (<a href="https://paultavares.wordpress.com/my-things/myboard-a-sharepoint-kanban-task-management-system/">link</a>). If you have gotten this far: you have already successfully installed this app, and that is all it takes to also install MyBoard.</p>

        <p class="octo-msg">To see a board here, select a List from the drop-down above and then a Column. Note that the board that will be displayed is not identical to the one used by MyBoard. MyBoard provides a much richer interface along with many other features.</p>

        <p class="octo-msg">Hope to have you as a supporter.</p>
