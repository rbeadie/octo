Camber has served as an engineering extension of the Apache project office from 2000 to 2015 to assist with the evolution of aircraft modification concepts into solutions that meet the needs of Army Aviators thereby avoiding rework due to misunderstood or loosely defined requirements. In support of this objective, Camber developed, maintains, and operates an Apache laboratory with aircraft software and hardware capabilities for the purposes of prototyping and mission-based evaluations/trials.  Camber engineers also provide project sustainment support to address maintenance, data backup, obsolescence, currency with the fielded aircraft, and upgrade of technology to perpetuate relevancy of the RACRS as a prototyping test bed.  On average, the RACRS program has 8-12 active task orders at all times, each with 9-18 months of duration.

This task consists of Network design, implementation, troubleshooting, analysis, and maintenance of G-BOSSs network. This also encompasses the software development required to integrate Cursor on Target (CoT) in to the G-BOSS 2.0 Software Baseline (EBRISS 4.0).  CoT is an XML schema for time-sensitive position information such as spot reporting, blue force tracking, and relocation requests.  Time-sensitive information that specifies the what, when and where information is considered critical, especially in asymmetric warfare arenas such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  Agility and responsiveness are the keys to military superiority.  The CoT event data model defines a terse XML schema and sub-schema extensions for exchanging time-sensitive positions of moving objects. The schemas are arranged in an object model with the intention of simplifying application development.  Rudimentary entities, such as event, detail, and points with limited attributes, are sufficient for almost 90 percent of all information transfers needed for battle management.  These entities can be further extended to provide additional details where necessary.  This allows smarter applications to exchange information beyond these rudimentary objects.  There will be two primary software development pieces.  The first piece will involve the production of an EBRISS driver to interface with CoT compliant external interfaces and all necessary modifications to the EBRISS server.  The second piece is the possible addition of a GUI widget to the EBRISS Client and all GUI control and visualization support for UAV Platform and Sensor Point of Interest CoT messages.  The final element of this task would include any necessary EBRISS Client infrastructure changes to communicate with the server.</div>","businessUnit":"TCE","projectNumber":"10835","projectManager":"Lewis, Patricia (HII-TSD)","customer":"USN","customerDetail":null,"contractType":"CPFF","contractValue":null,"practices":[],"placeOfPerformance":null,"primeContractor":null,"primeContractorName":null,"securityClearedWork":null,"securitySCIF":null,"technicalLead":null,"createdBy":"Wright, Rachel (HII-TSD)","updatedBy":"Wright, Rachel (HII-TSD)","created":"2018-06-26T11:19:46.000Z","updated":"2018-06-26T11:19:46.000Z"},
